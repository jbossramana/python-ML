In Python, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional tabular data structure, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
It is provided by the Pandas library and is one of the most commonly used data structures in data science
and analysis.

Here's an example of how to create a simple DataFrame in Python:

import pandas as pd

# create a dictionary of data
data = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'age': [25, 30, 35, 40],
        'gender': ['F', 'M', 'M', 'M']}

# create a DataFrame from the dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# print the DataFrame
print(df)


In this example, we first import the Pandas library. We then create a dictionary called data with three keys
(name, age, and gender) and corresponding lists of values.

We then create a DataFrame called df by passing the dictionary data to the pd.DataFrame() function. Finally,
we print the DataFrame, which displays the data in a tabular format with columns for name, age, and gender.

      name  age gender
0    Alice   25      F
1      Bob   30      M
2  Charlie   35      M
3    David   40      M
