In this example, we load medical data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. We then calculate the
mean, median, and standard deviation of patient ages, and print out the results. We also calculate
the number of patients by gender, and print out the results.

This example demonstrates some of the basic data analysis operations that can be performed using Pandas.
We can use Pandas to calculate summary statistics, perform filtering and grouping operations,
and visualize the data using built-in plotting functions. Pandas is a powerful tool for working
with medical data, and can help us to gain insights into patient health, diagnose diseases, and develop
new treatments.
