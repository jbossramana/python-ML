Suppose we have a CSV file called 'patient_records.csv' that contains records of patient visits to a hospital.
 Each record includes the patient's name, age, gender, weight, height, blood pressure, and diagnosis.

 In this example, we first load the 'patient_records.csv' file into a Pandas DataFrame using the read_csv() function.
 We then calculate some summary statistics such as the average age, weight, and height of the patients using the
 mean() function.

Next, we group the data by gender using the groupby() function and calculate the mean weight and height for each group
using the mean() function. We print the results using the print() function.

Finally, we create a scatter plot of weight vs. height for male patients using the plot() method of the Pandas DataFrame.
We first create a new DataFrame containing only the male patients using a boolean mask, and then call the plot() method
with the kind set to 'scatter' and the x and y parameters set to 'Weight' and 'Height', respectively. We also set the
title of the plot using the title parameter.
