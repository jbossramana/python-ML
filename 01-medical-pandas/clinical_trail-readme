Suppose we have a dataset containing information about patients in a clinical trial for a new drug.
The dataset has the following columns:

Patient ID
Age
Sex
Treatment (1 = new drug, 0 = placebo)
Response (1 = positive response, 0 = negative response)
We can use Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame and perform various analyses on the data. For example,
we can calculate the percentage of patients who responded positively to the new drug versus the placebo:

This code calculates the percentage of patients who responded positively to the new drug and the placebo,
as well as the difference in response rate between the two groups. This information can help researchers
evaluate the efficacy of the new drug and make decisions about its future development.
