In R, both = and <- are used to assign values to variables, but there are some subtle differences between them:

Assignment operator: The primary purpose of the <- operator is to assign values to variables, whereas = can
also be used for other purposes, such as passing arguments to functions.

Precedence: The <- operator has a higher precedence than the = operator, which means that R evaluates
expressions containing <- before expressions containing =.

Consistency with other languages: The <- operator is the standard assignment operator used in many programming
languages, such as C and Perl, whereas = is more commonly used in other contexts, such as mathematical equations.

Preference: Some R users have a personal preference for using one operator over the other, based on factors
such as readability or convention.
