R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides various
built-in data structures that are widely used in data analysis and manipulation. Some of the commonly used
R data structures include:

Vectors: A vector is a collection of values of the same data type. Vectors are used to store one-dimensional
data such as numbers, characters, or logical values. You can create a vector using the c() function in R.

Matrices: A matrix is a two-dimensional array that stores data of the same type. Matrices are used to store
tabular data and perform matrix operations such as matrix multiplication and inverse. You can create a matrix
using the matrix() function in R.

Arrays: An array is a multi-dimensional data structure that stores data of the same type. Arrays are used to
store data that is more than two-dimensional. You can create an array using the array() function in R.

Lists: A list is a collection of objects of different data types. Lists are used to store complex data structures
such as data frames and nested lists. You can create a list using the list() function in R.

Data frames: A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure that stores data of different data types. Data frames
 are used to store data in a tabular format with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. You can create a data
 frame using the data.frame() function in R.

Factors: A factor is a data structure used to represent categorical data. Factors are used to store data in a fixed
set of categories, such as gender or color. You can create a factor using the factor() function in R.

Time series: A time series is a sequence of data points that are recorded over time. Time series data are used in
various applications such as finance, economics, and environmental science. You can create a time series object using
the ts() function in R.

These are some of the commonly used data structures in R. Understanding the different data structures is essential
for data analysis and manipulation in R.


========================
R does not have a built-in data structure called "set". However, you can implement sets in R using other data
structures, such as vectors or lists.

my_set <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 4, 10, 2)
my_set <- unique(my_set)
