tidyverse package, which is a collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization:

Certainly! Here's an explanation of each line of code in the example I provided:

scss
Copy code
library(tidyverse)
This line loads the tidyverse package, which is a collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization.

arduino
Copy code
set.seed(123)
This line sets the seed for reproducibility. Setting the seed ensures that the random numbers generated by the code 
will be the same every time it is run with the same seed.

r
Copy code
n <- 100
This line sets the number of participants to 100.

sql
Copy code
group <- sample(c("Treatment", "Control"), n, replace = TRUE)
This line assigns participants to the treatment and control groups using the sample() function. The c() function creates a 
vector of the two group names. The n argument specifies the number of samples to take, and the replace argument 
specifies whether or not sampling should be done with replacement.

age <- round(rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 10))
This line generates age data for the participants using the rnorm() function, which generates normally distributed random 
numbers. The mean argument specifies the mean of the distribution, and the sd argument specifies the standard deviation. 
The round() function is used to round the ages to the nearest integer.


gender <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), n, replace = TRUE)
This line assigns genders to the participants using the sample() function, similar to how the groups were assigned.


outcome <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = ifelse(group == "Treatment", 0.3, 0.1))
This line generates binary outcome variable data for the participants using the rbinom() function, which generates 
random binomial numbers. The size argument specifies the number of trials, which is 1 in this case since the outcome 
variable is binary. The prob argument specifies the probability of success, which is 0.3 for the treatment group and 0.1 
for the control group. The ifelse() function is used to create a vector of probabilities based on the assigned group.


sim_data <- tibble(Group = group, Age = age, Gender = gender, Outcome = outcome)
This line creates a tidy data frame using the tibble() function to store the simulated data. The Group, Age, Gender, and 
Outcome variables are assigned using the vectors generated earlier.


sim_data %>% head()
This line uses the %>% operator to pipe the tibble to the head() function, which displays the first few rows of the data frame.
